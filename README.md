Argus
=======

Argus is a python package with multiple tools for 3D camera calibration and reconstruction. Argus Panoptes had thousands of eyes, but you may only have two or more cameras.  Hopefully this will help.

### How do I get set up?

Users new to Python should follow the full [installation instructions](docs/installation.md) to get started.

### Quick installation instructions

#### Option 1: Install with pip (recommended for most users)

**Step 1: Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

A virtual environment keeps your argus_gui installation separate from other Python packages on your system.

1. Open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv argus_env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source argus_env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     argus_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   
   You should see `(argus_env)` at the beginning of your command prompt when the environment is active.

**Step 2: Install argus_gui**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/backyardbiomech/argus_gui.git
```

**Step 3: Run the GUI**

```bash
argus-gui
```

**For future use:** Remember to activate your virtual environment each time before using argus_gui:
- macOS/Linux: `source argus_env/bin/activate`
- Windows: `argus_env\Scripts\activate`

Then run: `argus-gui`

**Note:** The installation will automatically handle the `sba` and `argus` dependencies from GitHub.

**Troubleshooting:** 

- If during use you encounter an error related to `cv2` or `opencv`, or if omnidirectional calibration fails with `INITIAL_FISHEYE` not defined, you need the contrib package:
  ```bash
  # With pip:
  pip uninstall opencv-python
  pip install opencv-contrib-python
  
  # With uv:
  uv pip uninstall opencv-python
  uv pip install opencv-contrib-python
  ```

- If you (especially on Windows) encounter an error related to `ffmpeg`, or `ffplay`, download the latest version of `ffmpeg` add it to your system's PATH using <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.


#### Option 2: Install with conda (if you prefer conda)

1. Right-click this link and select "Save Link As..." or "Download Linked File As..." : <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backyardbiomech/argus_gui/main/Argus.yaml">Argus.yaml</a> (save it as `Argus.yaml`, not `Argus.yaml.txt`).
2. Install [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) or anaconda on your computer. 
3. Open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).
4. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded `Argus.yaml` (probably your Downloads folder). You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```   
   cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads
   ```

5. Run the command:
   ```
   conda env create -f Argus.yaml
   ```
6. Activate the environment:
   ```
   conda activate argus
    ```
7. Open the gui with the command:
   ```
   argus-gui
   ```

8. To start the GUI in the the future, open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt, activate the environment with:
   ```
   conda activate argus
   ```
   and then run:
   ```
   argus-gui
   ```
